Since the output of one stage is the input to the next stage, the overall gain of the cascade connection is the product of the gains of the individual op amp circuits.

$$ A = A_1A_2A_3 $$

Although the cascade connection does not affect the op amp input-output relationships, care must be exercised in the design to ensure that the load due to the next stage in the cascade does not saturate the op amp.
