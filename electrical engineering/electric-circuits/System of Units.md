### Charge and Current

The most basic quantity in an electric circuit is the electric charge.

Charge is an electrical property of the atomic particles of which matter consists, measured in Coulombs (C).

The charge e on an electron is negative and equal in magnitude to 1.602 x 10^-19 while a proton carries a positive charge of the same magnitude as the electron. The presence of equal numbers of protons and electrons leaves an atom neutrally charged. 

The following points are noted:

1. The Coulomb is a large unit for charges. in 1 C of charge, there are 1 / (1.602 x 10^-19 ) = 1. 6.24  10^18 electrons. Thus realistic or laboratory values of charges are on the order of pC, nC, uC.
   
2. According to experimental observations, the only charges that occur in nature are integral multiples of the electronic charge e.
   
3. The law of conservation of charge states that charge can neither be created nor destroyed, only transferred. Thus, the algebraic sum of the electric charges in a system does not change.

A unique feature of electric charge or electricity is that it is mobile; that is, it can be transferred from one place to another, where it can be converted to another form of energy.

It is conventional to take the current flow as the movement of positive charges. That is, opposite to the flow of negative charges. Although we now know that current in metallic conductors is due to negatively charged electrons, we will follow the universally accepted convention that current is the net flow of positive charges.

Electric current is the time rate of change of charged, measured in amperes (A).

Mathematically, the relationship between current i, charge q, and time is

$$ i \triangleq \frac{dq}{dt} $$ 
where current is measured in amperes (A), and 1 ampere = 1 coulomb / s.

The charge between time and t is obtained by integrating both sides, obtaining:

$$ Q \triangleq \int_{t_0}^{t} i dt $$
The way current is defined as i suggests that current need to be a constant-valued function.

If the current does not change with time, but remains constant, we call it a direct current. A direct current (ac) is a current that remains constant with time.

By convention, the symbol I us used to represent such a constant current. A time-varying current is represented by the symbol i. A common form of time-varying current is the sinusoidal current or alternative current (ac).

### Voltage
The voltage between two points in an electric circuit is the energy or work needed to move a unit charge from a to b. Mathematically,

$$ v_{ab} \triangleq \frac{dw}{dq} $$
where $w$ is energy in joules (J) and q is charge in coulombs (C). The voltage $v$ is measured in volts (V).

$$ 1 volt = 1 joule/coloumb = 1 newton-meter/coulomb $$
Thus, voltage (or potential difference) is the energy required to move a unit charge through an element, measured in volts (V).

Current or voltage are the two basic variables in electric circuits. The common term signal is sued for an electric quantity such as current or voltage when it is used for conveying information.


### Power and Energy

Power is time rate of expending or absorbing energy, measured in watts (W).

$$ p \triangleq \frac{dw}{dt} $$
where $p$ is power in watts (W), $w$ is energy in joules (J), and $t$ is time in seconds (s). It follows that

$$ p = \frac{dw}{dt} = \frac{dw}{dq} \cdot \frac{dq}{dt} = vi $$
or
$$ p = vi $$

The power $p$ is a time-varying quantity and is called the instantaneous power. Thus, the power absorbed or supplied by an element is the product of voltage across the element and the current through it.

If the power has a $+$ sign, power is being delivered to to or absorbed by the element. If power has a $-$ sign, power is being supplied by the element.

The law of conservation of energy means that the algebraic su, of power in a circuit, at any instant of time, must be zero.

This confirms the fact that the total power supplied to the circuit must balance the total power absorbed.

The energy absorbed or supplied by an element from time $t_0$ to $t$ is 

$$ w = \int_{t_0}^{t} p dt = \int_{t_0}^{t} vi dt $$
Energy is the capacity to do work, measured in joules (J).



WE can analyze linear circuit by obtaining a set of simultaneous equations that are then solved to obtain the required values of current of voltage.
