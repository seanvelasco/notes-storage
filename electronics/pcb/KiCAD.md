The typical workflow in KiCAD consists of two main tasks - drawing a schematic and laying out a circuit board.

The schematic is a symbolic representation of the circuit - which components are used and what connections are made between them.

The board is the physical realization of the schematic, with component footprints positioned on the board and copper tracks making the connections described in the schematic. Footprints are a set of copper that match the pins on a physical component.
