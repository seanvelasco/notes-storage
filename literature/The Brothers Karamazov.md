His only recollection of his mother was that of a crying woman pleading the church to take him in. This image is akin to Mother Mary.

His relationship with is father. Fyodor Pavlovich does not pay him any mind. But one thing he said to Alyosha was that perhaps it is only him who does not think ill of him, that he still sees that he is redeemable. This brought him to tears.

Alyosha is utterly indifferent to the value of money. He can hold on to money for years without spending. But at the same time, he may lose it all, if someone were to ask money or scam him. Despite this relationship with money, he is always taken care of financially by those who took him in.

If he were suddenly left alone to die in a strange and foreign land, he won't freeze or starve. People will always take him in.

He has an affinity to the Church.
