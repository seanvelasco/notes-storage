我 我要 我要你 我要你的  
我要你的愛 你為甚麼不走過來  
我 我要 我要你 我要你的  
我要你的愛 你為甚麼不說出來
  
Listen to your Mama and you never will regret it  
And if anybody wonders you can tell them I said it  
The only thing I know is that I never can forget you  
I’ve been longing for you baby ever since the day I met you  
I got you where I want you  
And I’m never gonna let you get them away from me  
Hear what I tell you  
  
I’m a girl for you and so you better start to face it  
If you ever lose my love you know you never can replace it  
I think it’s time for you to start to give me some loving  
Carrying a torch for you that’s hotter than an oven  
It’s time for you to give me a little turtle dove baby hold me tight  
Then do what I tell you

只要說聲愛 你為甚麼不  
為甚麼不 為甚麼不肯說愛
